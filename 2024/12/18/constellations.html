    <h2>Constellations</h2>
    <em>12/18/24</em>
    <p>Astronomy is a cultural universal; everyone does it. It's easy to think of it as being a difficult science for the big-brains to ponder, but just looking at the stars and moon is astronomy. No need to gatekeep it.</p>
    <p>Constellations are fun, because they come with stories. In modern urban settings, too many people know constellations only from line diagrams in a textbook. Kills the joy of it. They look so much better and more convincing as images when you see them in the real sky. The outlines don't do them justice; even the middle stars contribute to the image. If you haven't seen it, make a drive out this weekend to a dark area and take a look.</p>

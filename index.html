    <h2>Sonnet 57, by Kim Addonizio</h2>
      <p><em>12/20/24</em></p>
      <p>I've heard Addonizio described as "Bukowski in a sun dress." Not inaccurate. </p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><em>I hate hearts please don't have one<br />I wish you wouldn't call me I'm not waiting<br />by the phone by the light of the clock<br />in fact I'm really busy right now<br />describing things that takes a lot of time<br />you'd be surprised how much drinking<br />&amp; and looking out the window it requires<br />there's not much room for anything else<br />all I need is a closet really a little space<br />for a shoe and I can live on crackers<br />no problem I love crackers are you eating<br />some now what do they taste like are you taking<br />them in your mouth then kissing<br />my princess I remain your sickening servant<br /></em></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>I'm fond of how the lack of punctuation makes each line ambiguous until you read the next one. "All I need is a closet really a little space" could be a standalone thought, and it's not until you read "for a shoe" that you realize it isn't.</p>
    <h2>How To Make A Roux</h2>
      <i>12/19/24</i>
      <p>Roux is easy. There are only two ingredients: flour and a fat. In France, they use butter as the fat, but in Louisiana, oil is preferred. A benefit of using oil is you can get a darker roux, which has a more rich flavor, though it has less thickening power.</p>
      <p>You'll want a few hours, a pan, preferably cast iron, a flat-tipped wooden spoon, and just about equal parts oil and flour, slightly favoring flour. Cast iron retains heat well, so use a low fire. Mix the flour bit by bit into the oil, and stir constantly to break up clumps. It will start to bubble after a while. Keep stirring. Scrape the bottom of the pan, or the flour will stick and burn. When the bubbles stop, you'll start to get a darker and darker shade. You're going for the color of chocolate.</p>
      <p>When you hit the chocolate shade, remove the roux from the pan. If you keep it in the pan, it will keep cooking and burn. Use it to add flavor and thickness to stews. Make a gumbo.</p>
    <h2>Constellations</h2>
      <i>12/18/24</i>
      <p>Astronomy is a cultural universal; everyone does it. It's easy to think of it as being a difficult science for the big-brains to ponder, but just looking at the stars and moon is astronomy. No need to gatekeep it.</p>
    <p>Constellations are fun, because they come with stories. In modern urban settings, too many people know constellations only from line diagrams in a textbook. Kills the joy of it. They look so much better and more convincing as images when you see them in the real sky. The outlines don't do them justice; even the middle stars contribute to the image. If you haven't seen it, make a drive out this weekend to a dark area and take a look.</p>

    <h2>Tom Bombadil</h2>
    <em>12/26/24</em>
    <p>Tom Bombadil is the most important character in the <em>Fellowship of the Ring</em>. Any decision to cut him reflects poorly on the adaptation, as it suggests the adaptor didn't understand the book.</p>
    <p>The Lord of the Rings is not a story about a quest to destroy the ring. If it were, the destruction of the ring would be the climax, but in fact the ring is destroyed in chapter 3 of book six; right at the beginning. The book then continues on for six chapters until it reaches the actual climax: the scouring of the Shire, where we are told that the Shire "is worse than Mordor" and in fact "is Mordor."</p>
    <p>If the scouring of the Shire is the climax, then what was the quest? Everywhere the fellowship goes, it finds the same spiritual flaw, namely acedia, a listless unwillingness to pursue a known good. The elves, Rohan, and Gondor are all beset by this vice. By the actions of the Fellowship, however, and chiefly the hobbits, acedia is driven away, bringing life back into the realms it was driven from.</p>
    <p>If the hobbits are the life-giving saviours of the novel, then it stands to reason that their home should embody their virtues. In fact it does not. No place in the novel is as affected by sloth as the Shire, even from the start. It is not idyllic but idle.</p>
    <p>Tom Bombadil is thus the model of the entire novel, the microcosm of the quest. He is not idle, but full of life. He is the Shire without crippling acedia. In his face, the ring simply doesn't matter. It's impotent to him because it is secondary to the real quest: restoring life to dead realms and dispelling vice. His exorcisms of Old Man Willow and the Barrowwight are miniature versions of Saruman's grip on Theoden being broken and of Denethor with Faramir on the pyre.</p>
    <p>Removing Tom Bombadil from the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> pulls the foundation of the novel out from under it, turning it into a trite, overplayed action story.</p>
    
    <h2>Merry Christmas!</h2>
    <em>12/25/24</em>
    <p>What are you doing here? Go love your family and friends.</p>

    <h2>Galayette II</h2>
    <em>12/24/24</em>
    <p>Apparently it's spelled Galayet, and it isn't a French but a Palestinian meal. I'm also told I'm doing it wrong, but the accounts of what is wrong are conflicting and inconsistent.</p>
    <p>Let's say that Galayet is the traditional Palestinian version, and Galayette is my bastardized French version. Now we can all be happy.</p>

    <h2>Galayette</h2>
    <em>12/23/24</em>
    <p>You will need:</p>
    <ul><li>half an onion</li><li>four cloves of garlic</li><li>tomatoes, either two big ones or fifteenish small ones</li><li>olive oil</li><li>two peppers, either jalapeno or habanero</li></ul>
    <p>Heat a medium skillet to a medium-high heat and coat cooking surface in olive oil. Dice onion, garlic, and pepper. Add to pot. Saute. Remove one half of the ingredients, put to the side. Try not to steal the oil when you do. Add tomatoes sliced into thumb-sized pieces. Lower heat slightly. Add a bit of salt. Cook for fifteen minutes or so. Add back in the stuff you removed before serving. Goes well with rice.</p>

    <h2>Ippon</h2>
    <em>12/22/24</em>
    <p>Judo matches end when one person gets an ippon. Some people don't like this. "It makes the sport boring: they fight defensively and fish for ippon." Some people would like to see the rules change, perhaps require two ippons for a win.</p>
    <p>Ippon is a win because if you throw someone that way on anything but soft mat, they're not getting up. Control of the opponent after they are slammed backwards into the hard earth doesn't matter. The fight is over.</p>
    <p>If you want to talk about allowing leg grabs, fine, but ippon means you win. That's non-negotiable.</p>
    
    <h2>Simple Websites</h2>
    <em>12/21/24</em>
    <p>A tool has a purpose and is good insofar as it performs the job for which it was created. A good hammer drives nails well. One doesn't expect a hammer to be beautiful, merely to perform the job expected of it. In a way, the simplicity and effectiveness of the hammer becomes its own beauty; it can be admired for what it does, its function-driven design becoming pleasing to the eye.</p>
    <p>The internet is a tool for moving information. A website aims to communicate something in words, pictures, or sounds. The web is an effective and efficient tool. Jane Austen's <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> can be loaded at less than a megabyte. On the slowest of internet connections, it loads in less than a second. The Bible presented the same way takes only a little longer.</p>
    <p>Which raises a question. If entire novels can load in less than a second, why does it take a modern website half a minute to load in all the little pieces? Why does the actual content of a website, the words, pictures, and sounds we're here for, take so damned long to appear?</p>
    <p>The reason is that the modern web is overbuilt, an obese javascript monstrosity. The social media links at the bottom of the blog post are larger than Jane Austen and the Bible together, and yet they do almost nothing in terms achieving the goal for which the site was made: to present information.</p>
    <p>This website is a simple file with a little styling. It loads quickly. It communicates effectively. Like the hammer, beautiful in its effectiveness, this website is more beautiful than all of the modern internet together. It has no advertisements, no cookies to accept or decline, it doesn't want your method of payment. It just presents information. Let's make more websites like this.</p>
    
    <h2>Sonnet 57, by Kim Addonizio</h2>
      <em>12/20/24</em>
      <p>I've heard Addonizio described as "Bukowski in a sun dress." Not inaccurate. </p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><em>I hate hearts please don't have one<br />I wish you wouldn't call me I'm not waiting<br />by the phone by the light of the clock<br />in fact I'm really busy right now<br />describing things that takes a lot of time<br />you'd be surprised how much drinking<br />&amp; and looking out the window it requires<br />there's not much room for anything else<br />all I need is a closet really a little space<br />for a shoe and I can live on crackers<br />no problem I love crackers are you eating<br />some now what do they taste like are you taking<br />them in your mouth then kissing<br />my princess I remain your sickening servant<br /></em></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>I'm fond of how the lack of punctuation makes each line ambiguous until you read the next one. "All I need is a closet really a little space" could be a standalone thought, and it's not until you read "for a shoe" that you realize it isn't.</p>
    
    <h2>How To Make A Roux</h2>
      <em>12/19/24</em>
      <p>Roux is easy. There are only two ingredients: flour and a fat. In France, they use butter as the fat, but in Louisiana, oil is preferred. A benefit of using oil is you can get a darker roux, which has a more rich flavor, though it has less thickening power.</p>
      <p>You'll want a few hours, a pan, preferably cast iron, a flat-tipped wooden spoon, and just about equal parts oil and flour, slightly favoring flour. Cast iron retains heat well, so use a low fire. Mix the flour bit by bit into the oil, and stir constantly to break up clumps. It will start to bubble after a while. Keep stirring. Scrape the bottom of the pan, or the flour will stick and burn. When the bubbles stop, you'll start to get a darker and darker shade. You're going for the color of chocolate.</p>
      <p>When you hit the chocolate shade, remove the roux from the pan. If you keep it in the pan, it will keep cooking and burn. Use it to add flavor and thickness to stews. Make a gumbo.</p>
    
    <h2>Constellations</h2>
      <em>12/18/24</em>
      <p>Astronomy is a cultural universal; everyone does it. It's easy to think of it as being a difficult science for the big-brains to ponder, but just looking at the stars and moon is astronomy. No need to gatekeep it.</p>
    <p>Constellations are fun, because they come with stories. In modern urban settings, too many people know constellations only from line diagrams in a textbook. Kills the joy of it. They look so much better and more convincing as images when you see them in the real sky. The outlines don't do them justice; even the middle stars contribute to the image. If you haven't seen it, make a drive out this weekend to a dark area and take a look.</p>

    <h2>Hello World!</h2>
    <em>12/17/24</em>
    <p>Christmas break is here. I tend to get bored when I have no students, so I made this website by hand. It's good and simple.</p>

    <h1>Constellations</h1>
    <p>Astronomy is a cultural universal; everyone does it. It's easy to think of it as being a difficulty science for the big-brains to think about, but just looking at the stars and moon is astronomy. No need to gatekeep it.</p>
    <p>Constellations are fun, because they come with stories. In modern urban nations, too many people know constellations only from line diagrams in a textbook. Kills the joy of it. They look so much better and more convincing as images when you see them in the real sky. The outlines don't do them justice; even the middle stars contribute to the image. If you haven't seen it, make a drive out this weekend to a dark area and take a look.</p>

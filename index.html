	<div class="headlink"><h2 id="Snow">Summer Break <a href="#Summer Break">#</a></h2></div>
	<em>5/31/25</em>
	<p>It's summer break for the second week now. Going nuts.</p>
	<p>In Cicero's <i>Pro Quinctio</i>, Publius Quinctius' brother went into a business agreement with a guy named Naevius. Naevius was a chatty dude, not much going for him but charisma. Some doubts as to why Publius' brother worked with him at all. Brother dies, leaves Publius his half of the business. Naevius and Publius are now associates.</p>
	<p>Publius wants to sell off some jointly owned land to pay his debts. Naevius says no, offers to pay the debts himself. Does not. Publius has to sell privately owned land to pay the debts. Brings Naevius to court, they never reach an agreement.</p>
	<p>They have a couple more disputes, but the big one is that Naevius goes to court when Publius is out of town, tells the judge Publius was supposed to show up today in court to settle a matter but is absent. Judge rules on the matter in favor of Naevius, even though Publius never agreed or even knew this court date was happening. Publius comes home, finds that Naevius has taken some of his property as part of this fraudulent settlement. They come to blows over it. For the next two years, there's a back-and-forth legal battle, with Naevius having hired an extremely good lawyer and Publius unable to keep his lawyer. He hires Cicero, then twenty-something.</p>
	<p>Cicero says this whole thing stinks. Comes close to commenting on the political circumstances (Sulla), has thoughts about rich folk taking advantage of everyone else. Says the edict the judge gave Naevius doesn't even give him the right to take land in settlement at all, legality of the faked settlement date aside.</p>
	<p>Unknown who won. I doubt Cicero would record the speech if he didn't.</p>

	<em>1/23/25</em>
	<p>Never really saw snow before a few days ago. It fell once or twice, and melted before noon. But Tuesday, it fell all day. Ten inches. Unbelievable. Piled up all over my car. Covered the road so we couldn't even see it.</p>
	<p>State basically shut down for three days. I just left the house for the first time this afternoon. It's melting slowly, but everything is still white.</p>
	<p>Mixed feelings. It's pretty. It's cold, though, and unpleasantly so besides. I got plenty of photos from my students of them enjoying it, but mostly I was concerned about the pipes and damage to my home. None, thankfully.</p>
	<p>They're saying this might happen again in a few weeks. I think once was enough.</p>

	<em>1/16/25</em>
	<p>Beignets are a French donut. The French recipe doesn't use yeast, but in Louisiana I've never seen an unleavened beignet. I learned the recipe this way:</p>
	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<ul><li>3 cups flour, all-purpose preferred</li><li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li><li>3 tablespoons sugar</li><li>1 cup warm milk</li><li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li><li>1 egg</li><li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li></ul>
	<h3>Method</h3>
	<p>Combine flour, salt, and 2 tablespoons of sugar. Combine milk, 1 tablespoon sugar, and yeast. Let the yeast get foamy. Takes maybe 4-5 minutes. Beat the egg into the wet mix, add the wet to the dry. Mix by hand. Dough will be ugly. Add the butter. Knead until dough isn't ugly. Takes me about five minutes. It will never not be sticky. Put dough ball into covered bowl to rise for an hour or two.</p>
	<p>To cook it, roll it flat and cut it into squares. Fry in a neutral oil, coat with powdered sugar while hot. Eat them hot. Cold beignets aren't that great.</p>

	<em>1/14/25</em>
	<p>I believe I wrote this in Fall '17. It's a curtal sonnet, which is a form pioneered by G.M. Hopkins, whom it consciously imitates in other ways.</p>
	<p>Maybe it's the best thing I ever wrote. I don't know.</p>
	<blockquote><em><p>Once I was walking, waiting for morning bells<br>&emsp; Ringing, swinging from church-peak, blooming sound<br>&emsp; &emsp; Weak in the distance, from bell-tower bounding down,</p>
	<p>Every mile wider and quieter. Cast-metal spells<br>&emsp; And cantations of virgins, in melodies made or found<br>&emsp; &emsp; Lying around a religion’s ruins, drown</p>
	<p>On rose-mellow clouds, sound off curtains drawn<br>&emsp; To ward away morning, and the tolling knells resound<br>&emsp; &emsp; From the shrouds, part the heavy window-gowns</p>
	<p>And stop. The sound was gone too long, and dawn<br>&emsp; &emsp; Rung silent through town.</p></em></blockquote>

	<em>1/13/25</em>
	<p>I don't really like breaks from teaching. Work is important for my mental wellbeing. That said, the winter break is far better than the summer one, for having family everywhere and things to do most days. I run out of imaginative ways to spend my time other than reading in the summer after about a month.</p>
	<p>Τᾶν. Greek word. Could be romanized as <em>tân</em>. It means something like "buddy." It only appears in direct adresses, so you can't say, for instance, "my τᾶν Evan lives in Russia," but you <em>can</em> say "Hey τᾶν, come look at this!"</p>
	<p>High on my list of favorite words. Interesting in that it is short: one syllable in a language notorious for long words. It's casual in a language seen as sophisticated, brings a sense of localness to a language that can feel distant. Can be said in a friendly way, or with an insulting overfamiliarity, as Socrates uses it in <em>Apology</em> to refer to Meletus. It has, most importantly, that nebulous quality of sounding exactly like what it means.</p>

	<em>1/3/15</em>
	<p>You will need:</p>
	<ul><li>1 cup of flour</li><li>1/3rd cup of water</li><li>generous pinch of salt</li><li>olive oil</li></ul>
	<p>Self-explanatory. Whisk the dry ingredients, add the water, knead until smooth. Let it rest for thirty minutes or so. Heat a skillet and the oil. Roll the dough very flat, cook about a minute on each side.</p>
	<p>It's not the tastiest bread ever made, though the olive oil helps. It's a bit chewy. Makes a good base for adding some other flavor. The draw for me to this stupid recipe is that flour has the best calories:cost ratio in the whole grocery store. It even beats out pure sugar, and rice is a close third. The above is a ~500 calorie meal for about a dollar, most of which is the smidgen of oil. The flour is around fifteen cents.</p>

  <p>Francis does have a strong grasp of one word: <em>bird</em>. He can say it, though not the final consonant, and he lowers and rounds the vowel to /œ/ rather than rhotacising it, consistent with his inability to pronounce diphthongs. He is surprisingly good at identifying birds both real and artificial, and he identifies very abstract representations of birds as well. I'm not sure what on what basis he identifies them, but I suspect it has something to do with beaks, since his only real false positives are snowmen with carrot noses.</p>
  <p>He is also beginning to develop a notion of cats, also pronounced without the final consonant and a voiced onset, though he incorrectly identifies most dogs as cats.</p>
  <p><b>Post Scriptum</b>: He can also say and identify <em>boob</em>.</p>

  <em>1/1/25</em>
  <p><em>Auld Lang Syne</em> is not written in English but in Scots, which is a different language from English, having diverged around the 14th century. It is to a large degree (though not entirely) mutually intelligible with English. This makes it somewhat unique. English speakers are used to different languages being entirely incomprehensible, but for most of the languages in the world, there is another, nearby language which is similar enough to be understood, but you'd have to sit down and learn it to fully understand or speak it yourself. The Romance languages are like this. English, however, has no sisters but Scots. You can listen to a man speak Scots for several minutes and understand everything, until suddenly the sounds coming out his mouth seem like meaningless garble for several seconds before returning to understandable.</p>

  <em>12/31/24</em>
  <p>We used to light fireworks with dad. Simple fun. We never did big displays, always prefering cheap, small fare. Our favorite item was a strobe-light, which is a magnesium strip that flashes silently as it burns, and it burns long and hot. We used to take the husks of little paper-tanks and light them on fire with strobes. Drop them into the spent tubes. Toss them into the ditch to see if they burn underwater. The fires were more interesting than the actual fireworks.</p>

  <em>12/30/24</em>
  <p>I had expected Francis to have an easy time learning the word <em>wow</em>. In theory, it isn't difficult. It has wide application, can be used in a variety of contexts, expresses an emotion babies seem to feel often, and the mechanical motion of producing the word is simple. It's a bilabial approximate on both sides of a low central vowel. In other words, it's <em>OO-AAA-OO</em> said quickly enough that the <em>OO</em> sounds blend into a <em>W</em> sound.</p>
  <p>In fact it has been very difficult to get him to learn this word. Both diphthongs and approximate sounds seem above his actual ability. He has internalized the <em>sense</em> of the word, but since I spent so much time saying it in a lower, somewhat throaty voice, he mostly just says <em>AAA</em> in a similar, throaty way while pointing at things that evoke wonder. He gets it. He just can't say it yet.</p>

  <em>12/29/24</em>
  <p>Keep dryer lint in a bag, don't dispose of it. When you want a fire, take some, mix twigs and small sticks into it, and surround it with easy-burning, thin bits of wood. Build a log cabin-like structure around that. Ignite with a match or a lighter, and fan it to get your fire going.</p>
  <p>Fire has wide symbolic use. It's light, warmth, anger, love, consumption, control and loss of control at the same time. If there is life on other planets, and it lives underwater (very likely, given what we know of life), it is unlikely to have much in the way of technology, since the use of fire is so integral to technological progress.</p>
  <p>I enjoy fires. I like the popping sounds the wood makes. I like coaxing it out of wood. Even if it doesn't work, in the worst case scenario, there's always lighter fluid, which is it's own pleasure.</p>

  <p>I'm not a fan. It's come up several times while we play Mario Galaxy this week: I don't like the yellow-colored levels in a broad sense. Megan recalled my mentioning months ago that when I first saw the Erdtree in Elden Ring, I knew I'd look for someone who would want it gone. The best rationale I could give at the time is that is was too yellow.</p>

  <p>My brother Johnny and I get to hang out this time of year for weeks instead of days, so we usually pick an old game and run through it again. Unusual choice this year in <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>, which Johnny never played growing up, though Thomas and I finished it when it first came out.</p>
  <p>The ghost levels are stand-outs in quality. I remember enjoying the lava levels more than I actually do now. Flying is harder than I remember it, but still fun.</p>
  <p>I'll miss Johnny and Megan when they leave. The first half of the year is the time I see them least. Will visit for Mardi Gras. Francis will be six months older by the time I can spend more than a weekend of time with him, though.</p>
    
  <div class="headlink"><h2 id="Tom Bombadil">Tom Bombadil <a href="#Tom Bombadil">#</a></h2></div>
  <em>12/26/24</em>
  <p>Tom Bombadil is the most important character in the <em>Fellowship of the Ring</em>. Any decision to cut him reflects poorly on the adaptation, as it suggests the adaptor didn't understand the book.</p>
  <p>The Lord of the Rings is not a story about a quest to destroy the ring. If it were, the destruction of the ring would be the climax, but in fact the ring is destroyed in chapter 3 of book six; right at the beginning. The book then continues on for six chapters until it reaches the actual climax: the scouring of the Shire, where we are told that the Shire "is worse than Mordor" and in fact "is Mordor."</p>
  <p>If the scouring of the Shire is the climax, then what was the quest? Everywhere the fellowship goes, it finds the same spiritual flaw, namely acedia, a listless unwillingness to pursue a known good. The elves, Rohan, and Gondor are all beset by this vice. By the actions of the Fellowship, however, and chiefly the hobbits, acedia is driven away, bringing life back into the realms it was driven from.</p>
  <p>If the hobbits are the life-giving saviours of the novel, then it stands to reason that their home should embody their virtues. In fact it does not. No place in the novel is as affected by sloth as the Shire, even from the start. It is not idyllic but idle.</p>
  <p>Tom Bombadil is thus the model of the entire novel, the microcosm of the quest. He is not idle, but full of life. He is the Shire without crippling acedia. In his face, the ring simply doesn't matter. It's impotent to him because it is secondary to the real quest: restoring life to dead realms and dispelling vice. His exorcisms of Old Man Willow and the Barrowwight are miniature versions of Saruman's grip on Theoden being broken and of Denethor with Faramir on the pyre.</p>
  <p>Removing Tom Bombadil from the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> pulls the foundation of the novel out from under it, turning it into a trite, overplayed action story.</p>

  <p>Apparently it's spelled Galayet, and it isn't a French but a Palestinian meal. I'm also told I'm doing it wrong, but the accounts of what is wrong are conflicting and inconsistent.</p>
  <p>Let's say that Galayet is the traditional Palestinian version, and Galayette is my bastardized French version. Now we can all be happy.</p>

  <div class="headlink"><h2 id="Galayette">Galayette <a href="#Galayette">#</a></h2></div>

  <p>You will need:</p>
  <ul><li>half an onion</li><li>four cloves of garlic</li><li>tomatoes, either two big ones or fifteenish small ones</li><li>olive oil</li><li>two peppers, either jalapeno or habanero</li></ul>
  <p>Heat a medium skillet to a medium-high heat and coat cooking surface in olive oil. Dice onion, garlic, and pepper. Add to pot. Saute. Remove one half of the ingredients, put to the side. Try not to steal the oil when you do. Add tomatoes sliced into thumb-sized pieces. Lower heat slightly. Add a bit of salt. Cook for fifteen minutes or so. Add back in the stuff you removed before serving. Goes well with rice.</p>

  <em>12/22/24</em>
  <p>Judo matches end when one person gets an ippon. Some people don't like this. "It makes the sport boring: they fight defensively and fish for ippon." Some people would like to see the rules change, perhaps require two ippons for a win.</p>
  <p>Ippon is a win because if you throw someone that way on anything but soft mat, they're not getting up. Control of the opponent after they are slammed backwards into the hard earth doesn't matter. The fight is over.</p>
  <p>If you want to talk about allowing leg grabs, fine, but ippon means you win. That's non-negotiable.</p>

  <p>A tool has a purpose and is good insofar as it performs the job for which it was created. A good hammer drives nails well. One doesn't expect a hammer to be beautiful, merely to perform the job expected of it. In a way, the simplicity and effectiveness of the hammer becomes its own beauty; it can be admired for what it does, its function-driven design becoming pleasing to the eye.</p>
  <p>The internet is a tool for moving information. A website aims to communicate something in words, pictures, or sounds. The web is an effective and efficient tool. Jane Austen's <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> can be loaded at less than a megabyte. On the slowest of internet connections, it loads in less than a second. The Bible presented the same way takes only a little longer.</p>
  <p>Which raises a question. If entire novels can load in less than a second, why does it take a modern website half a minute to load in all the little pieces? Why does the actual content of a website, the words, pictures, and sounds we're here for, take so damned long to appear?</p>
  <p>The reason is that the modern web is overbuilt, an obese javascript monstrosity. The social media links at the bottom of the blog post are larger than Jane Austen and the Bible together, and yet they do almost nothing in terms achieving the goal for which the site was made: to present information.</p>
  <p>This website is a simple file with a little styling. It loads quickly. It communicates effectively. Like the hammer, beautiful in its effectiveness, this website is more beautiful than all of the modern internet together. It has no advertisements, no cookies to accept or decline, it doesn't want your method of payment. It just presents information. Let's make more websites like this.</p>

  <p>I've heard Addonizio described as "Bukowski in a sun dress." Not inaccurate. </p>
  <blockquote>
  <p><em>I hate hearts please don't have one<br />I wish you wouldn't call me I'm not waiting<br />by the phone by the light of the clock<br />in fact I'm really busy right now<br />describing things that takes a lot of time<br />you'd be surprised how much drinking<br />&amp; and looking out the window it requires<br />there's not much room for anything else<br />all I need is a closet really a little space<br />for a shoe and I can live on crackers<br />no problem I love crackers are you eating<br />some now what do they taste like are you taking<br />them in your mouth then kissing<br />my princess I remain your sickening servant<br /></em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>I'm fond of how the lack of punctuation makes each line ambiguous until you read the next one. "All I need is a closet really a little space" could be a standalone thought, and it's not until you read "for a shoe" that you realize it isn't.</p>

  <em>12/19/24</em>
  <p>Roux is easy. There are only two ingredients: flour and a fat. In France, they use butter as the fat, but in Louisiana, oil is preferred. A benefit of using oil is you can get a darker roux, which has a more rich flavor, though it has less thickening power.</p>
  <p>You'll want a few hours, a pan, preferably cast iron, a flat-tipped wooden spoon, and just about equal parts oil and flour, slightly favoring flour. Cast iron retains heat well, so use a low fire. Mix the flour bit by bit into the oil, and stir constantly to break up clumps. It will start to bubble after a while. Keep stirring. Scrape the bottom of the pan, or the flour will stick and burn. When the bubbles stop, you'll start to get a darker and darker shade. You're going for the color of chocolate.</p>
  <p>When you hit the chocolate shade, remove the roux from the pan. If you keep it in the pan, it will keep cooking and burn. Use it to add flavor and thickness to stews. Make a gumbo.</p>

  <p>Astronomy is a cultural universal; everyone does it. It's easy to think of it as being a difficult science for the big-brains to ponder, but just looking at the stars and moon is astronomy. No need to gatekeep it.</p>
  <p>Constellations are fun, because they come with stories. In modern urban settings, too many people know constellations only from line diagrams in a textbook. Kills the joy of it. They look so much better and more convincing as images when you see them in the real sky. The outlines don't do them justice; even the middle stars contribute to the image. If you haven't seen it, make a drive out this weekend to a dark area and take a look.</p>

	  <h2>Morning Bells</h2>
	  <em>1/14/25</em>
	  <p>I believe I wrote this in Fall '17. It's a curtal sonnet, which is a form pioneered by G.M. Hopkins, whom it consciously imitates in other ways.</p>
	  <p>Maybe it's the best thing I ever wrote. I don't know.</p>
	  <blockquote><em><p>Once I was walking, waiting for morning bells<br>&emsp; Ringing, swinging from church-peak, blooming sound<br>&emsp; &emsp; Weak in the distance, from bell-tower bounding down,</p>
	  <p>Every mile wider and quieter. Cast-metal spells<br>&emsp; And cantations of virgins, in melodies made or found<br>&emsp; &emsp; Lying around a religion’s ruins, drown</p>
	  <p>On rose-mellow clouds, sound off curtains drawn<br>&emsp; To ward away morning, and the tolling knells resound<br>&emsp; &emsp; From the shrouds, part the heavy window-gowns</p>
	  <p>And stop. The sound was gone too long, and dawn<br>&emsp; &emsp; Rung silent through town.</p></em></blockquote>

    <h2>Happy New Year!</h2>
    <em>1/1/25</em>
    <p><em>Auld Lang Syne</em> is not written in English but in Scots, which is a different language from English, having diverged around the 14th century. It is to a large degree (though not entirely) mutually intelligible with English. This makes it somewhat unique. English speakers are used to different languages being entirely incomprehensible, but for most of the languages in the world, there is another, nearby language which is similar enough to be understood, but you'd have to sit down and learn it to fully understand or speak it yourself. The Romance languages are like this. English, however, has no sisters but Scots. You can listen to a man speak Scots for several minutes and understand everything, until suddenly the sounds coming out his mouth seem like meaningless garble for several seconds before returning to understandable.</p>

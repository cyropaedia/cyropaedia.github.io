	  <h2>Break is Over</h2>
	  <em>1/13/25</em>
	  <p>I don't really like breaks from teaching. Work is important for my mental wellbeing. That said, the winter break is far better than the summer one, for having family everywhere and things to do most days. I run out of imaginative ways to spend my time other than reading in the summer after about a month.</p>
	  <p>Τᾶν. Greek word. Could be romanized as <em>tân</em>. It means something like "buddy." It only appears in direct adresses, so you can't say, for instance, "my τᾶν Evan lives in Russia," but you <em>can</em> say "Hey τᾶν, come look at this!"</p>
	  <p>High on my list of favorite words. Interesting in that it is short: one syllable in a language notorious for long words. It's casual in a language seen as sophisticated, brings a sense of localness to a language that can feel distant. Can be said in a friendly way, or with an insulting overfamiliarity, as Socrates uses it in <em>Apology</em> to refer to Meletus. It has, most importantly, that nebulous quality of sounding exactly like what it means.</p>

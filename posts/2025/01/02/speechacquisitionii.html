	  <h2>Speech Acquisition II</h2>
    <em>1/2/25</em>
    <p>Francis does have a strong grasp of one word: <em>bird</em>. He can say it, though not the final consonant, and he lowers and rounds the vowel to /œ/ rather than rhotacising it, consistent with his inability to pronounce diphthongs. He is surprisingly good at identifying birds both real and artificial, and he identifies very abstract representations of birds as well. I'm not sure what on what basis he identifies them, but I suspect it has something to do with beaks, since his only real false positives are snowmen with carrot noses.</p>
    <p>He is also beginning to develop a notion of cats, also pronounced without the final consonant and a voiced onset, though he incorrectly identifies most dogs as cats.</p>
    <p><b>Post Scriptum</b>: He can also say and identify <em>boob</em>.</p>

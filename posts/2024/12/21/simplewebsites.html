    <h2>Simple Websites</h2>
    <em>12/21/24</em>
    <p>A tool has a purpose and is good insofar as it performs the job for which it was created. A good hammer drives nails well. One doesn't expect a hammer to be beautiful, merely to perform the job expected of it. In a way, the simplicity and effectiveness of the hammer becomes its own beauty; it can be admired for what it does, its function-driven design becoming pleasing to the eye.</p>
    <p>The internet is a tool for moving information. A website aims to communicate something in words, pictures, or sounds. The web is an effective and efficient tool. Jane Austen's <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> can be loaded at less than a megabyte. On the slowest of internet connections, it loads in less than a second. The Bible presented the same way takes only a little longer.</p>
    <p>Which raises a question. If entire novels can load in less than a second, why does it take a modern website half a minute to load in all the little pieces? Why does the actual content of a website, the words, pictures, and sounds we're here for, take so damned long to appear?</p>
    <p>The reason is that the modern web is overbuilt, an obese javascript monstrosity. The social media links at the bottom of the blog post are larger than Jane Austen and the Bible together, and yet they do almost nothing in terms achieving the goal for which the site was made: to present information.</p>
    <p>This website is a simple file with a little styling. It loads quickly. It communicates effectively. Like the hammer, beautiful in its effectiveness, this website is more beautiful than all of the modern internet together. It has no advertisements, no cookies to accept or decline, it doesn't want your method of payment. It just presents information. Let's make more websites like this.</p>

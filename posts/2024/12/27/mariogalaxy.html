    <h2>Mario Galaxy</h2>
    <em>12/27/24</em>
   	<p>My brother Johnny and I get to hang out this time of year for weeks instead of days, so we usually pick an old game and run through it again. Unusual choice this year in <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>, which Johnny never played growing up, though Thomas and I finished it when it first came out.</p>
    <p>The ghost levels are stand-outs in quality. I remember enjoying the lava levels more than I actually do now. Flying is harder than I remember it, but still fun.</p>
    <p>I'll miss Johnny and Megan when they leave. The first half of the year is the time I see them least. Will visit for Mardi Gras. Francis will be six months older by the time I can spend more than a weekend of time with him, though.</p>

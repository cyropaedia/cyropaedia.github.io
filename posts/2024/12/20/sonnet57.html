    	<h2>Sonnet 57, by Kim Addonizio</h2>
    	<em>12/20/24</em>
      <p>I've heard Addonizio described as "Bukowski in a sun dress." Not inaccurate. </p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><em>I hate hearts please don't have one<br />I wish you wouldn't call me I'm not waiting<br />by the phone by the light of the clock<br />in fact I'm really busy right now<br />describing things that takes a lot of time<br />you'd be surprised how much drinking<br />&amp; and looking out the window it requires<br />there's not much room for anything else<br />all I need is a closet really a little space<br />for a shoe and I can live on crackers<br />no problem I love crackers are you eating<br />some now what do they taste like are you taking<br />them in your mouth then kissing<br />my princess I remain your sickening servant<br /></em></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>I'm fond of how the lack of punctuation makes each line ambiguous until you read the next one. "All I need is a closet really a little space" could be a standalone thought, and it's not until you read "for a shoe" that you realize it isn't.</p>

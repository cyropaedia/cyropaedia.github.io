    <h2>How To Make A Roux</h2>
    <em>12/19/24</em>
    <p>Roux is easy. There are only two ingredients: flour and a fat. In France, they use butter as the fat, but in Louisiana, oil is preferred. A benefit of using oil is you can get a darker roux, which has a more rich flavor, though it has less thickening power.</p>
    <p>You'll want a few hours, a pan, preferably cast iron, a flat-tipped wooden spoon, and just about equal parts oil and flour, slightly favoring flour. Cast iron retains heat well, so use a low fire. Mix the flour bit by bit into the oil, and stir constantly to break up clumps. It will start to bubble after a while. Keep stirring. Scrape the bottom of the pan, or the flour will stick and burn. When the bubbles stop, you'll start to get a darker and darker shade. You're going for the color of chocolate.</p>
    <p>When you hit the chocolate shade, remove the roux from the pan. If you keep it in the pan, it will keep cooking and burn. Use it to add flavor and thickness to stews. Make a gumbo.</p>

    <h2>Fires</h2>
    <em>12/29/24</em>
   	<p>Keep dryer lint in a bag, don't dispose of it. When you want a fire, take some, mix twigs and small sticks into it, and surround it with easy-burning, thin bits of wood. Build a log cabin-like structure around that. Ignite with a match or a lighter, and fan it to get your fire going.</p>
    <p>Fire has wide symbolic use. It's light, warmth, anger, love, consumption, control and loss of control at the same time. If there is life on other planets, and it lives underwater (very likely, given what we know of life), it is unlikely to have much in the way of technology, since the use of fire is so integral to technological progress.</p>
    <p>I enjoy fires. I like the popping sounds the wood makes. I like coaxing it out of wood. Even if it doesn't work, in the worst case scenario, there's always lighter fluid, which is it's own pleasure.</p>

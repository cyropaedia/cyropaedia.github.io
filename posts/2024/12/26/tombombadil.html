    <h2>Tom Bombadil</h2>
    <em>12/26/24</em>
    <p>Tom Bombadil is the most important character in the <em>Fellowship of the Ring</em>. Any decision to cut him reflects poorly on the adaptation, as it suggests the adaptor didn't understand the book.</p>
    <p>The Lord of the Rings is not a story about a quest to destroy the ring. If it were, the destruction of the ring would be the climax, but in fact the ring is destroyed in chapter 3 of book six; right at the beginning. The book then continues on for six chapters until it reaches the actual climax: the scouring of the Shire, where we are told that the Shire "is worse than Mordor" and in fact "is Mordor."</p>
    <p>If the scouring of the Shire is the climax, then what was the quest? Everywhere the fellowship goes, it finds the same spiritual flaw, namely acedia, a listless unwillingness to pursue a known good. The elves, Rohan, and Gondor are all beset by this vice. By the actions of the Fellowship, however, and chiefly the hobbits, acedia is driven away, bringing life back into the realms it was driven from.</p>
    <p>If the hobbits are the life-giving saviours of the novel, then it stands to reason that their home should embody their virtues. In fact it does not. No place in the novel is as affected by sloth as the Shire, even from the start. It is not idyllic but idle.</p>
    <p>Tom Bombadil is thus the model of the entire novel, the microcosm of the quest. He is not idle, but full of life. He is the Shire without crippling acedia. In his face, the ring simply doesn't matter. It's impotent to him because it is secondary to the real quest: restoring life to dead realms and dispelling vice. His exorcisms of Old Man Willow and the Barrowwight are miniature versions of Saruman's grip on Theoden being broken and of Denethor with Faramir on the pyre.</p>
    <p>Removing Tom Bombadil from the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> pulls the foundation of the novel out from under it, turning it into a trite, overplayed action story.</p>

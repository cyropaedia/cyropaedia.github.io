    <h2>Speech Acquisition I</h2>
    <em>12/30/24</em>
    <p>I had expected Francis to have an easy time learning the word <em>wow</em>. In theory, it isn't difficult. It has wide application, can be used in a variety of contexts, expresses an emotion babies seem to feel often, and the mechanical motion of producing the word is simple. It's a bilabial approximate on both sides of a low central vowel. In other words, it's <em>OO-AAA-OO</em> said quickly enough that the <em>OO</em> sounds blend into a <em>W</em> sound.</p>
    <p>In fact it has been very difficult to get him to learn this word. Both diphthongs and approximate sounds seem above his actual ability. He has internalized the <em>sense</em> of the word, but since I spent so much time saying it in a lower, somewhat throaty voice, he mostly just says <em>AAA</em> in a similar, throaty way while pointing at things that evoke wonder. He gets it. He just can't say it yet.</p>

    <h2>Ippon</h2>
    <em>12/22/24</em>
    <p>Judo matches end when one person gets an ippon. Some people don't like this. "It makes the sport boring: they fight defensively and fish for ippon." Some people would like to see the rules change, perhaps require two ippons for a win.</p>
    <p>Ippon is a win because if you throw someone that way on anything but soft mat, they're not getting up. Control of the opponent after they are slammed backwards into the hard earth doesn't matter. The fight is over.</p>
    <p>If you want to talk about allowing leg grabs, fine, but ippon means you win. That's non-negotiable.</p>

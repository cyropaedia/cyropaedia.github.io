    <center><h1>Shortsword: Core Rules</h1></center>
    <p><i>Shortsword</i> is a ruleset designed for roleplay over text chat. To facilitate ease of play and to better fit the medium, it minimizes dice rolls, and is indifferent to who rolls.</p>
    <h2>Basic Play</h2>
    <p>The game is a conversation, not a writing workshop. All replies should be as quick and efficient as the cut of a blade. Turn paragraphs to sentences, three sentences to one.</p>
    <p>The narrator describes the scene. The player asks questions, then states their intended actions. The narrator resolves the actions. Repeat.</p>
    <p><strong>Narrators,</strong> give information liberally, honestly, and accurately. Assume the player's character is competent and skilled. Be unbiased. Never, ever fudge a roll.</p>
    <p><strong>Players,</strong> do not skip asking questions. Trust the narrator to give accurate and helpful information. Be ambitious. Be ruthless. Never fight fair. Expect nothing, try to take everything. Accept losses gracefully.</p>
    <p>The mechanics below do not pretend to cover every possibility. When you find the rules contradict common sense, ignore them. When they are too simple to handle a situation, make a new rule that can do it.</p>
    <h2>Resolving Actions</h2>
    <p>Most of the player's actions succeed automatically. Player characters are assumed to be competent.</p>
    <p>If for some reason there is doubt that the player would succeed so easily, use a die to resolve the action. Roll two dice, and add them together. The action is successful if the result beats the difficulty set by the referee. In general, common actions have a difficulty of 6, difficult actions a difficulty of 8, and hard or impossible actions a 10 or higher.</p>
    <p>Never, ever fudge rolls.</p>
    <p>Playing over text chat means, unless you use an application that rolls dice, that only the person who rolls the die can see the result. It's generally easier for the narrator to roll the die and then narrate the result.</p>
    <p>Combat is not a special case, and fights are resolved the same way as other actions.</p>
    <h2>Inventory</h2>
    <p>The player can carry up to three items. A backpack can carry another five. Small items can be bundled into one slot. Pack animals and followers can help carry supplies.</p>
    <h2>Advancement</h2>
    <p>There are no levels. Characters do not get more hits. Gaining power in-universe is the only way to advance. Examples of in-universe power:
    <ul>
    <li>Vast wealth
    <li>Allies
    <li>A fortified base
    <li>An army
    <li>A cult
    <li>Magic items
    <li>Spells
    </ul>
